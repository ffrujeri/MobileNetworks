v1.0.6
  - Rewriter.isEntity returns false for interfaces
  - turned off UDP info output in default jist.properties
  - implemented jist.swans.app.lang.SimtimeThread
      see driver.threaded for an example
  - implemented thread.join()

v1.0.5
  - JistAPI.sleepBlock: implemented blocking sleep in API for convenience

v1.0.4
  - shortened filenames of cached continuation classes
  - throw meaningful NoSuchMethod exception when proxy entity of 
    wrong type provided as an event target
  - do not compute flow of native methods
  - check for uninitialized objects on continuation stack
  - throw meaningful exception early if tcp/udp entity has not been set 
    within the AppJava application context
  - fix: jist.swans.Constants.BANDWIDTH_DEFAULT = 1e6, because 
    Mb = 10^6 b! Thanks to David Choffnes for reporting this 
    embarrasing error.
  - fixes to Mac802.11 suggested by David Choffnes to take care of some common
    exceptions that occur during unicast operation. still need to verify
    entire unicast functionality.

v1.0.3
  - JistAPI.DoNotRewrite tag added
  - fix: RadioNoiseAdditive SNR calculation (reported by Matthias Wille)
  - more meaningful error message when detecting a return address
    on a stack to be saved for continuation.
  - jist/swans/route/RouteDsr: enum is java 1.5 keyword
  - fix: DoNotRewrite disables JiST... and now also SWANS(!) rewriting

v1.0.2
  - swans.Rewriter: inhibit method signature changes to methods outside the
    SWANS or application codebase (reported by Gabi Kliot)
  - RadioNoiseAdditive: properly initialize total power to background noise
  - RadioNoiseIndep: consider background noise (reported by Einar Vollset),
    reducing the effective transmission range when using default radio
    parameters
  - renamed/added/cleaned up some examples in driver directory
  - NetIp: promisc mode packets processed like any other packet
  - fix: in RadioNoiseIndep (line 137) due to Gabi Kliot: only set mode to
    idle if signals==0
  - change jist/swans/misc/makefile to ignore performance-enhancing native
    library compilation errors
  - fix: NullPointerException in classloader -> ClassNotFoundException
  - fix: data flow analysis modified to ignore JSR return addresses
  - fix: jump target lost during rewrite when immediatelly before blocking
    call (reported by Einar Vollset)

v1.0.1
  - added sleep functionality/mode to radios, requested by Ivan Lysiuk
  - converted jist.swans.net.MessageQueue into an interface to allow multiple
    queue implementation, requested by Ivan Lysiuk
  - minor bug in RadioNoiseIndep.setThresholdSNR reported by Thomas Bernoulli
  - guilog functionality by Mark Fong
  - minor touchups, commenting, etc.

v1.0.0
  - Intial release of JiST and SWANS
